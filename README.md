# homebrew-avr

This repository contains the GNU AVR Toolchain as formulae for [Homebrew].

AVR is a popular family of micro-controllers, used for example in the [Arduino] project.

## Current Versions

- GCC 9.3.0 - **default**, provided as `avr-gcc` or `avr-gcc@9`
- GCC 5.5.0 - provided as `avr-gcc@5`
- GCC 8.4.0 - provided as `avr-gcc@8`
- GCC 10.2.0 - provided as `avr-gcc@10`
- GCC 11.1.0 - provided as `avr-gcc@11`
- Binutils 2.35.1 - provided as `avr-binutils`
- AVR Libc 2.0.0 - provided as a resource for each GCC formula
- GDB 10.1 - provided as `avr-gdb`

Support for older GCC versions (4, 6, 7) has been removed. Please, raise an issue if you need one back.

## Installing homebrew-avr formulae

First, make sure you have xcode command line developer tools installed with

```console
$ xcode-select --install
```

Then, just run the following to install the latest version of `avr-gcc`:

```console
$ brew tap osx-cross/avr
$ brew install avr-gcc
```

If you want to install a different version:

```console
$ brew install avr-gcc@{x}
```

Where `{x}` being the version number such as `avr-gcc@8` or `avr-gcc@10`

**Note**: only the default version will be available in your `$PATH`. The other ones are `keg-only` and thus won't be available in `/usr/local/bin`.

You can run `brew info avr-gcc` or `brew info avr-gcc@{x}` for more information on the flags available.

## Docs

`brew info avr-gcc`, `brew help`, `man brew`, or the Homebrew [documentation].
